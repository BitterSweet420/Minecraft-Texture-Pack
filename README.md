# Info

Hi!, I am Bitter, I have a hobby of playing this specific game called "Minecraft". I enjoy it quite alot (though I am not good at it :/) and so I thought that I should make a texture pack that **should suit myself** while playing.

- The version is 1.16.5
- The totem's texture is my skin
- The enchanted golden apple (or the golden apple) is supposed to be a starbucks cup since they both have the samne effects xD
- Rename an axe "Mr. Jack" and it should change it's texture
- Rename a sword "Chop Suey!" and it should change it's texture too
- And yes both of the "names" are songs by System Of A Down (I am super uncreative lmao)
